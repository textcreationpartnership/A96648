      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>The Altitude, or Poles elevation, is an arch of the Meridian circle, intercepted between the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, and the end of the World's Axis; and the complements are the degrees and parts that it wants of 90, that is, an arch of the Meridian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained between the Pole elevated, and the places Zenith, which in all oblique Spheres is ever equal to an arch of the Meridian, intercepted betwixt the Horizon and the <hi>Aequator.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>right Aſcenſion</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> or any Star, or part of the Ecliptick, are the degrees of the <hi>Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial</hi> circle, that aſcends the Horizon with them, in a right Sphere, or the degrees of the <hi>Aequator,</hi> that do come unto the Meridian of any place with the ☉, <g ref="char:stella">✴</g>, or any other part of the Heavens, and thoſe reckoned from <hi>Aries</hi> to 360. degrees, in the <hi>Aequinectial</hi> circle, as were the former oblique Aſcenſions; and this is general in all oblique Spheres whatſoever, and the true degree in the <hi>Aequator,</hi> that aſcended the Horizon, the ☉, or <g ref="char:stella">✴</g> in a right Sphere.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Magnitude</hi> of a Star is to be underſtood only of the fixed, which for diſtinction, and the readier finding them in the Sphere, they are divided into ſix ſorts, the firſt being the greateſt, and ſo in order; but as for thoſe of the ſixt Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, or cloudy ones, they are but little obſerved in the predictions of the weather; yet are here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted with a Table of the <hi>Sun</hi>'s right Aſcenſion in hours and minutes; for every 15. degrees of the <hi>Aequator,</hi> is equal to an hour, and ſo each degree is equall to four minutes in time, as was ſaid before.</p>

                  <head>The ſeverall Aſeentions and Deſcentions of the fixed Stars and Planets.</head>
                  <p>THis is to be underſtood in reſpect of the hemiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere, and the Horizon of your place, and that in ſeveral ſenſes too; as a Star is ſaid (ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times) to be aſcending, not being come unto the Meridian of any place required; and when any Star is upon the Meridian, it is ſaid to be culmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and here you are to note, that the influence of any Star is then of moſt force to that place; and obſerve alſo in the aſpects of any Planet in ⚹ <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g> or <g ref="char:trine">△</g>; whether both theſe Planets thus aſpected are viſible in that hemiſphere at the ſame time? or which of them? and in what ſign? and whether aſcending towards the Meridian? or having paſt it, deſcending towards the Weſtern Horizon? but the aſcention and deſcention of the Stars, is uſually underſtood for the riſing and ſetting of any Star, according to the violent motion of the <hi>Primum Mobile;</hi> and in reſpect of the Horizontal circle, to that hemiſphere which they muſt paſſe, both aſcending and deſcending.</p>
                  <p>But know, that in all oblique Spheres (where either pole is elevated above the Horizon) that thoſe Stars can never ſet to that hemiſphere, whoſe declinations towards the pole elevated are greater then the complement of the poles elevation; and thoſe Stars whoſe declinations are as many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees towards the pole depreſſed, can never riſe: But if the declination; of any Star (towards either pole) be leſſe then the <hi>Aequators</hi> height above that Horizon, then all thoſe Stars (in every natural day)
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:116029:26"/>will both riſe and ſet; of which aſcentions and deſcentions of the Stars, there are three ſeveral kinds obſerved, both by the <hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Prognoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators</hi> of the weather, in the alteration of the Air: And are theſe,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Coſmicall.</hi> 2. <hi>Acronycall.</hi> And 3. <hi>Heliacall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe Stars are properly ſaid to riſe Coſmical, which do aſcend the Horizon with the ☉; as the Dog<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſtar doth in Summer, from whence they are called the Dog-dayes, beginning about the 20. day of <hi>July,</hi> and ending in the latter end of <hi>Auguſt:</hi> But in the largeſt ſenſe any Star is ſaid to riſe Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical, that aſcends the Horizon in the day time. The Coſmical ſetting of any Star, is when they do deſcend the Horizon at the ſame time when the ☉ riſes, or at any time of day, but not taken in the ſtricteſt ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Acronycal</hi> aſcention is the riſing of any Star when the ☉ ſets; as when the ☉ doth enter into the ſign ♒, and deſcending the Horiſon, the ſign ♌ will riſe at the ſame time, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called <hi>Acronycal,</hi> although it be often taken for a Star that aſcends the Horizon at any time of night; the <hi>Acronycal</hi> deſcenſion is ſaid of any Star that ſets with the ☉, as the little Dog-ſtar the 5. day of <hi>June;</hi> but this is alſo ſaid of any Star that ſets in the night time.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Heliacal</hi> riſing of any Star, is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of thoſe that have been obſcured with the Sun-beams; and the Sun moving according to the ſucceſſion of the ſigns, the Star begins again to appear at his riſing, a little before the Sun, as you may ſee in the Latitude of 52. g 0. And on the ſeventh of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the Lions heart quite obſcured,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:116029:26"/>and a few days after will be ſeen to riſe before the Sun; and the <hi>Heliacal</hi> ſetting, is any Star that is ſeen preſently after the Sun ſetting, and a few days after will be quite obſcured with the glory of his beams; as the 28. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold <hi>Spica Virginis</hi> in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and in a few days after offuſcated with the reſplendent radius of the Sun, his proper motion being Eaſt-ward. This I do deſire may ſatisfie (moſt courteous Reader) as an abſtract of the world; and if further ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction be deſired, vouchſafe to look over my books of Aſtronomy; and for the better recording (in your memory) the apparition and occultation of the Stars, accept of theſe verſes, though from a rude <hi>Minerva.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>AS</hi> for the word <hi>Meteors,</hi> it ſignifies an appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition in the <hi>Air</hi> (as taken in the common or uſual ſenſe) or high and lifted up: but in general there are two ſorts, one riſen from <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours</hi> and <hi>Exhalations,</hi> termed by the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> imperfect mixt bodies, by reaſon they are eaſily reduced into their firſt nature, or proper <hi>Element,</hi> as <hi>Hail</hi> or <hi>Snow,</hi> quickly reſolving into <hi>Water,</hi> and all thoſe which are accounted perfectly mixt, are <hi>thunder bolts,</hi> &amp;c. and the reaſon they do give, is becauſe that ſuch as theſe will not ſo ſoon be converted into their firſt <hi>Elements,</hi> from whence they were extracted or derived, the material cauſe of all, are hot and moiſt vapours, or hot and dry exhalations, from Water and Earth, the efficient cauſe (under <hi>God</hi>) is from the fixed and wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Stars,</hi> by vertue of whoſe beams a light rarifi'd ſubſtance is extracted from groſs and heavy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as vapours from water, and exhalations from Earth: their qualities, are heat and moiſture, which cauſeth diverſity of effects, eſpecially in thoſe leſſe perfectly mixt, which are the ſubjects now intended.</p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:116029:27"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vapours</hi> do conſiſt of the four Elements, but the ſubſtance water, as the ſteam of a boyling Pot, which hangs like a dew upon the lid, or cover over it: And <hi>Exhalations</hi> are commonly like ſmoak, of nature hot and dry, as you may behold in a Summers day to offuſcate the <hi>Air,</hi> or make it ſeem dusky with the aſcending of thin ſumes, and after this comes uſually thunder, which ſhews from whence theſe exhalations were extracted; for out of <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Air</hi> only no <hi>Meteor</hi> can conſiſt, as wanting matter, the <hi>Fire</hi> of it ſelf (as being an Element) is ſo ſubtile, that it cannot be purified; whereas all exhalations and vapours, muſt be refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and conſequently extracted from ſome groſſer body; for the <hi>Air</hi> (if much rarified) would turn to <hi>Fire;</hi> as you may ſee in violent and circular motions, of wheels or ſuch like things, that are ſet on fire by rarification of the <hi>Air,</hi> where the matter is dry and combuſtible: and when the <hi>Air</hi> becomes groſſe it turns to Water, as you may ſee by your breath, in the winter time, or the <hi>Air</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed in vaults, or other hollow places, will quickly be condenſed, by oppoſition of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Air,</hi> or coldneſſe of the place, eſpecially againſt rainy weather; but lot us now aſcend to unmask ſome other doubtful quaeries.</p>
               <p>The places where <hi>Meteors</hi> are generated, is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally held for to be in all, or any Region of the <hi>Air,</hi> which are three, <hi>viz.</hi> the upper from the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Fire</hi> to the clouds, the middle Region containing the clouds, the loweſt from the clouds unto the Earth; but <hi>Tycho Brahe,</hi> with ſome others, do conceive the Element of <hi>Air,</hi> for to be delated up into the <hi>Firmament</hi> or fixed <hi>Stars;</hi> but that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:116029:28"/>above the Element of <hi>Fire,</hi> to be of a Celeſtial nature, differing from the inferiour <hi>Air;</hi> and their reaſons are derived from the height of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets,</hi> obſerved not only above the Element of <hi>Fire,</hi> but with the <hi>Planets</hi> and ſome higher then the Sphere of <hi>Saturn,</hi> even with the fixed Stars, as the new Star in <hi>Caſſiopaeia</hi> which was ſeen, and the height taken by <hi>Ticho</hi> himſelf (in the year of the World's <hi>Redeemer,</hi> 1572) without <hi>parallax.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The proof of the altitude of <hi>Comets,</hi> is deduced from their <hi>Parallaxes,</hi> that is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the true and apparant height of any bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing <hi>Star</hi> (being obſerved from the ſuperficies of the terreſtrial <hi>Globe</hi>) and not from the center of the Heavens; and this difference is diſcovered ſeveral ways. Firſt, as by obſerving ſome noted and fixed <hi>Stars,</hi> aſcending the Horizon with it, or preſently before or after; and if they do keep the ſame diſtance, or neer unto it, that <hi>Comet</hi> muſt needs be very high; or by ſeveral obſervations made in other Countries; for if neer the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thoſe fixed <hi>Stars</hi> will appear with it in all Hemiſpheres alike: But if the diſtance between them varies, and in a ſmall diſtance of place or time, it argues thoſe blazing <hi>Stars</hi> are very low. And thus the <hi>Parallaxis</hi> of any thing viſible un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Firmament, will be found greater or leſſer, according to the height of it; As the <hi>Star</hi> in <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiopaeia</hi> appearing in the year of <hi>Grace,</hi> 1972. diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring but little or nothing in the Parallax, or the obſervations made by divers Aſtronomers in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Countries, in the year of the <hi>Virgin's</hi> being a 1585, there was a <hi>Comes</hi> appeared in the Sphere betwixt <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and an other in the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:116029:28"/>year of the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> 1618. between <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Mars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> with <hi>Regiomontanus,</hi> and many others of his followers, do affirm all <hi>Comets</hi> to be ſublunary: and this their Schollars do alledge, that if the Aſtronomical hypotheſes be true, the <hi>Star</hi> in <hi>Coſſiopaeia,</hi> was greater then the fixed <hi>Stars</hi> of the firſt magnitude, and conſequently (by their own demonſtrations) bigger then the whole <hi>Globe</hi> of <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Water</hi> above 100. times; and a greater body cannot be extracted from a leſſe; from whence then (ſay they) could the matter be drawn or exhaled to feed ſo great a light for the ſpace of a year and four months? but to this <hi>Galilaeus</hi> anſwers, that the higheſt Sky under the Firmament hath matter in it for the generation of theſe blazing <hi>Stars. Licetus</hi> to defend the height of <hi>Comets,</hi> doth argue that the Sky hath hard condenſed knots in it, made and enlightned by the rays both of the fixed and wandring <hi>Stars. Gemma Phryſius</hi> did diligently obſerve in 3. or 4. <hi>Comets,</hi> that their tails did ſtream or extend out directly contrary to the <hi>Sun,</hi> as if it were by him inlightned.

                  <p>Theſe exhalations having penetrated the middle region, and attained unto the height of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and circumvolved with a ſlimy matter, oylie, and apt to be inflamed; thus having aſſumed a body, is violently carried about with the <hi>Air,</hi> until with the motion and vicinity of the <hi>Fire</hi> it is

                  <p>
                     <hi>Comets,</hi> and all fiery <hi>Meteors</hi> are uſually moved with the Region they are in, and from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Weſt,</hi> according to the raptile motion of the Spheres: but <hi>Seneca</hi> affirms, that he did ſee one which moved parallel to the Horizon, from the North, by the Weſt into the South, and ſo by the Eaſt into the North again; and the contrary like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe may be ſo, the exhalations moving as the <hi>Air</hi> and according to the matter which does nouriſh it, as you may ſee fire in a ſtubble: and others have been ſeen to remove ſuddenly from one place to another, caſting forth ſparkles like fire; theſe by ſome are called <hi>Goats:</hi> and ſome have ſeemed as fixt, both in reſpect of their Latitudes and Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitudes.</p>

                  <head>The middle Region of Air and what is there generated.</head>
                  <p>THis Region, or middle part of the <hi>Air</hi> is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally conceived to be vehemently cold and moiſt by <hi>Antiperiſtaſis,</hi> and the effects do alſo prove the ſame: and this we ſee in all things that are oppugnant, incloſed and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by their contraries, being of greater force, doth cauſe the contrary incloſed (not being able to break forth) and withall repulſed by its oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, to contract and fortifie it ſelf: as by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence you may ſee in all living and ſenſitive Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that their inward parts are much hotter in
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:116029:32"/>Winter then in Sommer, and their ſtomachs apter and abler to digeſt; and the cauſe is, for that the heat is then repulſive to the inward parts, by the oppoſition and coldneſſe of the outward air; and beſides, you may ſee that the fire and all combuſtible things will burn more violently in Winter then in Sommer; and the colder the weather is, the more it ſcorches; the reaſon is the ſame in theſe; for the fire grows more violent, by how much the more it is oppoſed with the contrary quality of the ſubdued cold.</p>
                  <p>The caſe is the ſame in the middle Region of the <hi>Air;</hi> for the upper part is made hot by the violent motion of it, and the neerneſſe unto the Element of fire; and the lower Region is made hot by reflection of the Sun-beams; and ſo the cold included between them is the more violent, by how much the lower Region is inflamed with the <hi>Suns</hi> reflection, and ſo by that means is colder in the heat of <hi>Sommer</hi> then in <hi>Winter:</hi> But theſe diviſions or portions of the <hi>Air,</hi> have no deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined bounds, nor hath the Water in reſpect of quantity; for by the motion of the celeſtial bodies, cold and moiſture getting together, the Element of <hi>Water</hi> will increaſe, and the <hi>Air</hi> of neceſſity muſt then diminiſh; and with the coniunction of heat and moiſture, the Sphere of the <hi>Water</hi> will be diminiſhed, and the <hi>Air</hi> as much increaſed; ſo by this means the <hi>Air</hi> does more abound in <hi>Sommer</hi> then in <hi>Winter,</hi> and the <hi>Water</hi> more in <hi>Winter</hi> then in <hi>Sommer;</hi> and thus the middle Region is greater at one time then at another.</p>
                  <p>By the heat of the <hi>Sun</hi>-beams, and influence of the <hi>Stars, Meteors</hi> are elevated to the middle
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:116029:33"/>Region of the <hi>Air;</hi> thoſe which by nature are temperately hot and moiſt, are extracted from wet and wateriſh places; yet have ſo much heat as is ſufficient to elevate them unto the height of the middle Region, where by reaſon of the coldneſſe of that place, they are condenſed, and do generate there ſeveral kinds of mixt imperfect bodies; the clouds thus incorporated, are with the cold turned into Snow, congealed many times before it does ingender Water: And to prove this aſſertion, you may obſerve that Snow (if compacted or beaten together) is not ſo ſoon diſſolved into water, as Ice will be by the <hi>Sun</hi> or any other means; which argues, had it been water firſt, it would have been the ſooner reduced: Theſe vapours or thick exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, drawn up into the middle Region, are often digeſted and turned into water, from thence diſtilling down like miſts, or in very ſmall drops; for the greateſt rain is thought not to fall far through the <hi>Air,</hi> and out of the inferior part of the lower Region.</p>
                  <p>For it is generally conceived, the rain that falls from the middle Region, deſcends in little orbs, whereby to preſerve it ſelf, and reſiſt the violence of the <hi>Air</hi> through which it paſſeth, and becomes ſmall by reaſon of the diſtance and time in falling; for the Hall does demonſtrate both the bigneſſe and rotundity of the drops, which from humide exhalations drawn up unto the middle Region, and there converted into water, and immediately as the drops do diſtill down, they are contracted into Ice by the Airs coldneſſe in that part, which is called Hail; derived from the high <hi>Dutch Hagell,</hi> opparadventure from the <hi>Hebrew Egell,</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies congealed drops.</p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:116029:33"/>
                  <p>In the <hi>Winter</hi> ſeaſon it is ſeldome obſerved to Hail, by reaſon the cold in the middle Region is more remiſſe then in warm weather; and in <hi>Sommer</hi>-time it is alſo rare, upon any very hot day, becauſe the heat of the lower Region will not permit it for to paſs without diſſolving of it before it comes unto the <hi>Earth;</hi> but frequently in the <hi>Spring</hi> and <hi>Autumn,</hi> the heat being then ſufficient to elevate the matter, and yet not ſo violent as to diſſolve it in the fall; yet ſometimes it happens that great Hail-ſtones are precipitated at Mid-Sommer, or in very hot ſeaſons, and are then the greater, (if the matter be ſufficient) by how much the more it is oppoſed by the lower Region made hot by reflection of the <hi>Sun;</hi> for in all times of the year you may find (if obſerved) more and greater ſtorms of Hail to fall in the day time then in the night.</p>
                  <p>And ſome do conceive that there is a fiery nature included in them, beſides the heat of that ſubtile vapour which made it to aſcend that middle Region, for by contraries, it is undoubtedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed; as you may ſee in Salt (which is hot and dry) to be made of water, whoſe natural tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature is directly oppoſite, being cold and moiſt in open weather, or by the fire-ſide, or in Sommer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time; take a little Salt, and mix ſome Snow with it, ſtir them together till they do incorporate, and they will contract themſelves into Ice, which is done by <hi>Antiperiſtaſis,</hi> or repulſion on every part; as the middle Region of the <hi>Air</hi> is cold, and theſe frigide <hi>Meteors</hi> are ingenerated there. Many other things might be here inſerted, which for brevity ſake are omitted.</p>

Corn I have ſeen, that was after a ſhowre found upon the leads of Churches, and on the ground in divers places; it had the form of Wheat, but ſmall and without taſte, the colour of it pure white, both within and without.</p>
                  <p>The loweſt <hi>Meteor</hi> in the <hi>Air,</hi> is the burning candle, or as ſome call it, <hi>Ignis Fatuus:</hi> This is a hot and moiſt vapour, which ſtriving to aſcend, is repulſed by the cold, and fiered by <hi>Antiperiſtaſis,</hi> mov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THeſe are conceived to be vapours hot and moiſt, commixed with exhalations that be hot and dry; involved thus within one another, they do aſcend (by vertue of their heat) unto the middle region of the <hi>Air,</hi> where the exhalation by <hi>Antiperiſtaſis</hi> grows inflam'd, and ſtrives to get forth of the cloud in which is involved, and the upper part of the cloud (where the heat would paſſe) by oppoſition grows the ſtrongeſt, and the exhalation grown over-hot by being conſtrained, with violence breaks forth of the weakeſt place, againſt the weather that is in the loweſt part; and by reaſon of the cold above it, the heat and ſubtileneſſe of the exhalation, with its own vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in breaking forth, it glances down upon the earth without doing any harm, if unreſiſted; as conſuming a Sword without hurting the Scabbard; and many other things of this kind, unneceſſary, and too long for to relate.</p>
                  <p>The clap of Thunder is firſt, but the Lightning ſooneſt appears, by reaſon our ſenſe of ſeeing is much quicker then our hearing: As you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive at a diſtance a Man driving a Stake, or felling of Timber, you may behold him ready to ſtrike again, before you hear the former blow; and in ſhooting, or diſcharging of a Gun, you may ſee the fire before the report. With the conjunction of theſe compound vapours and exhalations, ſtones are generated in the <hi>Air,</hi> as other Minerals are in the Earth, but more fiery by nature, and theſe are
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:116029:37"/>called thunder-bolts, in their formes perfect cones, like the flame of fire which did generate them out of the terrene exhalation; it ſtrikes not above five feet into the earth, as ſome do affirm.</p>
                  <p>The remedies againſt Thunder and Lightning; all hard things will preſerve whas is ſoft and liquid; as Iron laid upon Veſſels, will keep the Liquor from ſowring, by the former alledged reaſons; beſides this, it is naturally reſiſted by a cover made of Seals skins, and preſerving that on which 'tis p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>But note, there may be Thunder without Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and Lightning without Thunder; for when theſe hot and dry exhalations are inflam'd, and the cloud weak (in which they are involv'd) the incenſed exhalation breaks forth without violence, in not being reſtrained; but the coldneſſe of the middle Region ſtrikes the falſhes downwards upon us, but not always upon the earth; but glittering and reflecting on the watry clouds, makes it ſeem cloſe by; as you may ſee by the <hi>Sun</hi> beams, or any other ſuddain light falling upon the water, will reverberate the luſtre, and dazle your eyes, eſpecially if the water be moved with any wind; theſe coruſcations are uſual in hot Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, or in the heat of <hi>Sommer.</hi>

                  <p>Thunder without Lightning does happen when theſe hot and dry exhalations break violently through the clouds (in which they are circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved) but not inflamed, yet making a roaring noiſe in the burſt of the cloud which reſtrained it; as you may ſee, little bladders filled with wind, will give a crack or report at the ſuddain and violent breaking of them; ſometimes Thunder will happen (and yet no Lightning appear) by reciprocal winds, the clouds violently break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves in meeting with one another; and this may often happen with inſurrections of ſeveral mutinous exhalations, diſturbing the <hi>Air</hi> with ſeveral commotions; theſe uſually proceed after much calm weather, but are very wholſome to purge the <hi>Air,</hi> leſt with too much quietneſſe it ſhould corrupt.</p>

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:116029:39"/>illuminated beams deſcribe his form, after an obſcure and imperfect manner, portraiting only an arch of a circle adorned uſually with three colours, <hi>viz.</hi> Red, Green, and Purple, or inclining unto a Blewiſh colour; the diſtinction of theſe proceeds from the Radius of the <hi>Sun</hi> reflecting upon theſe vapours; for thoſe colours are lighteſt in it which are neereſt to the <hi>Sun;</hi> and thoſe which are remoteſt, do tend more to obſcurity.</p>
                     <p>As for a demonſtration, you may behold in the commixture of ſuch like colours, and the form of the Rain-bow you may experimentally try, by caſting water in a circular manner againſt the <hi>Sun</hi> when he ſhines: But ſome doe think the red colour to be only made by his rays, the ſecond by refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and the third by the ſecond, all contained within ſome condenſed hollow cloud, commixed with Aiery and wateriſh exhalations; for if more Rain-bows do appear then one at any time, it is conceived that they are made by reflection of one another; but the colours in the ſecond will be weaker then thoſe in the firſt; and the third Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow more pallid then the ſecond. If there happens to be three, which is very ſeldome ſeen, then the colours in the firſt will be counterchanged in the ſecond, and the third again like the firſt: Theſe arches in the clouds or Rain-bows, do continue longer then do the circles about the <hi>Sun,</hi> becauſe the diſtance in theſe is ſo great, that his beams cannot ſo ſoon diſſipate the exhalation which cauſed them.

                  <p>Yet many exhalations and vapours are by the <hi>Sun</hi> extracted from the waters, and thoſe converted (by the vertue of his rays) into ſeveral <hi>Meteors,</hi> as moiſt and windy exhalations, which the <hi>Air</hi> gratefully does repay again unto the waters, as in a continual courſe of amity, and inſeparable league between them; the <hi>Air</hi> which is included within the pores of the <hi>Earth,</hi> is by nature ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, and gets into all the corners and hollow places, whereby to avoid a <hi>vacuum,</hi> which <hi>Nature</hi>

                  <p>THe <hi>Seas</hi> are conceived to be made ſalt and brackiſh by the fervour of the <hi>Sun</hi>'s rays, with the permixion of burnt exhalations, and chafed with the violent and perpetual motion of the flux and reflux of the waters; for by experience we find that liquid things, if hot and burnt, their tafte will be bitter, and with commotion will prove brackiſh; but it is very likely that the Seas were brackiſh from the creation, and by this means continued ſo; but ſome does object that if the rain-water were exhaled from the Seas, and that the Springs did flow from thence, the waters would retain a ſaltneſſe in their taſte; but as for that it appears evidently that the Rain is refined by vertue of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and the Spring-waters by their <hi>Meanders,</hi> in paſſing through the <hi>Earth;</hi> and this you may try by diſtilling of Salt-water, or putting it into Earth, ſo as it may drain forth, and in time it will loſe its ſaltneſſe, being but accidental.</p>

               <p>TO <hi>Prognoſticate,</hi> or foretel the alteration of the Weather, there hath been (in all Ages) diligent obſervers of <hi>Nature,</hi> who have preſcribed rules and prenotations of the <hi>Airs</hi> mutability, grounded on judicial ſigns, collected from the <hi>Stars</hi> and the four <hi>Elements,</hi> the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of all ſublunary bodies: Of theſe Predictions there be ſeveral kinds, both general and particular, eſtabliſhed by humane reaſon; ſome derived meerly from old experience, yet many of them true; divers obſervations are aſcribed to ſome particular Place, Country, Province, or leſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of this our habitable world, being often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times confined within the precincts of a pariſh, as by fogs or miſts aſcending from ſome meer or moriſh grounds; or deſcending from the tops of hills, high exalted places, and low depreſſed dales; ſome men do obſerve domeſtick and particular beaſts, as the ſtory of the Herdſ-man, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But as for all ſuch preſages (as are not general,

                     </gap>ven</hi>) with health and happineſſe.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Stars</hi> have their influences upon ſublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary bodies, it is not denied by any learned men, and affirmed undoublably by many of the moſt famous Philoſophers, Aſtronomers, and Divines, as witneſſe <hi>Ariſtotle, Ptolomaeus,</hi> and St. <hi>Auguſtine, lib.</hi> 13. <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. <hi>de Trin.</hi> and multitudes more which I have omitted, fearing to incumber this volume with teſtimonies and approbations of that which ſeems demonſtrated unto reaſon, and confirmed by experience; and according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> (with the conſent of many others) Thunder,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:116029:44"/>Lightning, Hail, Snow, Rain, Storms, and all alterations of the weather may be predicted by the riſing and ſetting of the fixed Stars, with the aſpects of Planets, their natures and qualities conſidered with the climate, region, and ſeaſon of the year.</p>
               <p>The Stars being ſuppoſed of ſeveral natures, and each conſtellation mixt, their influencies may cauſe diverſity of effects, as heat, cold, moiſture, or drought, which are the four qualities of the Element; and as for the Planets, they do alter according to their aſpects, which many learned Phiſitians do diligently obſerve in adminiſtring Phyſick, and in the time of their Patients falling ſick, calling the 7. day critical, the 14. &amp;c. Their reaſons are, the <hi>Moon</hi> having dominion over all humors and wateriſh bodies, and in her motion ſwift, doth paſſe in 7. days, and a little more, from one ſign into another of a contrary nature and quality, as from ♎ hot and moiſt, into ♑ cold and dry, and the like of others; from whence the Doctors do judge of the malignity of the diſeaſe, with the hopes of life, or danger of death; and of this you may read in <hi>Gallen (lib. 3. de diebus Criticis)</hi> rather then in me.</p>
               <p>And in prognoſtication of the Weather, theſe judicial days would be obſerved in the beginning of drought, Rain, Snow, Froſt or the like, and there would be conſidered the latitude and aſpects of the Planets, the nature of the ſigns they are in, paſſing under the fixed Stars, eſpecially where they are mixt with the nature of thoſe Planets: Conſider the ſeaſon of the year, as Hale, or Rain in the Spring, or Autumn, Thunder and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:116029:45"/>Lightning in Sommer, Froſt and Snow in Winter: Ponder alſo the riſing and ſetting of the fixed <hi>Stars,</hi> with the Planets, the Eclipſes, Comets and all fiery Meteors, and ſuch as theſe accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by nature, are juſtifiable; for God hath given man knowledge and underſtanding in the courſe of natural things and ſigns in the Heavens, whereby to avoid inconveniencies, not with a certain, but a conjectural ſcience, by the Aſteriſms or celeſtial configurations and the four Elements, from whence may be preſaged diſtempers of the <hi>Air,</hi> cauſing contagious diſeaſes, ſterility and the like; as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> writeth of <hi>Thaletes,</hi> who foretold the ſcarcity of Oyl that would be in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>But whether the <hi>Stars</hi> are of theſe mixt natures, or their temperatures be known, it remains as yet in diſpute, and not for me to argue, but only follow the tracts of other men, and their obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of the weather, delived from experience, but not preſume to ſearch into the decrees of Heaven, or predict the actions of men, with the event of future things, which many pretend to do; for although that God hath made figns in the Heavens, and hath enabled us to know the times and ſeaſons of the year, with all things neceſſary for us to underſtand, yet not to be inquiſitive in thoſe ſacred Ordinances, which the omnipotent <hi>Creator</hi> hath decreed and concealed from us, as unneceſſary to be known; and prohibited by the commands of the Doctors and Councels of the holy <hi>Catholike</hi> and <hi>Apoſtolike Church,</hi> to which ſacred Authority I do humbly ſubmit my ſelf.

                  <p>THe word <hi>Wind</hi> is derived from the inſtability of it, and ſignifies to turn; as for their natures and temperatures in general, they are hot and dry exhalations got together in multitudes, yet do retain part of the qualities from whence they are extracted, as from earth cold and dry, from water cold and moiſt vapours; ſome of theſe are called <hi>Anniverſary</hi> winds, as blowing at ſome certain time or ſeaſon of the year; others are called <hi>Provincial</hi> winds; ſo termed as from par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Provincies, no wind being general in all places, by <hi>Sea</hi> and <hi>Land;</hi> and ſome cauſed by
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:116029:54"/>great and high mountains in theſe Countrys; others derived from Lakes, Rivers, Seas, &amp;c. and denominated often from thence; as the <hi>Levant,</hi> or <hi>Subſolanus,</hi> called alſo the Eaſt-wind; how they have been anciently divided and nominated; See <hi>Pliny, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 47. of his natural Hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>There may be as many winds as there be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed diviſions in the <hi>Horizon,</hi> which the <hi>Sea-men</hi> (to avoid confuſion) do divide into 32. points, repreſented by the Compaſs, diſtinguiſhing thoſe points and parts of the Horizontal circle, by ſeveral and peculiar names; and ſo alſo the winds anſwering to thoſe points, whereof in this I will uſe but eight, being ſufficient for prognoſtication, and the chiefeſt that are obſerved: And firſt, the four principal or cardinal points are theſe, <hi>North, South, Eaſt, Weſt,</hi> dividing the Horizon into four quadrants or 90. degrees aſunder; and thoſe equally divided by four points more; all the eight being 45. degrees from one another, and are theſe <hi>North eaſt,</hi> and <hi>North-weſt, South-eaſt,</hi> and <hi>South-weſt:</hi> As for the temperatures of theſe particular winds, they are ſo uncertain in every Country, that I will write nothing of them more, but refer you to the ſecond part of this Book; for in theſe Countrys the North-wind is cold and dry; the South-winds warm and moiſt, making our bodies generally dull, and cauſeth moiſt weather, and pains in the head; whereas in the Southern parts of <hi>America,</hi> and the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> the effects of theſe winds are quite contrary, participating of that nature from whence thoſe exhalations were extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: But the ſigns preſaged by the <hi>Stars,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the obſervations of learned men, are theſe following.</p>

                  <head>Generall Aphoriſms in Prognoſticating ſtorms and tempeſts, ſelected out of Cardanus, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginus and Durret.</head>
                  <p>THe twelve Signes of the Zodiack doe contain the nature of the four Elements; and theſe twelve Signes (by tranſmutation of their places) are divided into four Trigones, each of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the temperature and qualities of one Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as was declared already in the Worlds Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy; and being they are conceived to have their ſeverall effects in producing of particular winds, I will once again inſert them, <hi>v.z.</hi> ♈ ♌ &amp; ♐ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth Northweſt winds, ♊ ♎ &amp; ♒ produceth Northeaſt winds, ♋ ♏ &amp; ♓ cauſeth Southweſt winds, ♉ ♍ &amp; ♑ raiſeth Southeaſt winds: and thus are the twelve Signs appropriated to the four points of the horizon, equally between the four cardinall winds; yet you muſt conſider the nature of the fixed and wandring Stars aſcending with them, in every particular Horizon.</p>
                  <p>The preſaging of the winds depends upon many cauſes, and are as various as they be inconſtant; and beſides all this, you muſt know the winds are appropriated unto each proper Planet, as the Eaſt to ♄, the North to ♃, the Weſt to ♂, the South to ♀, and ☉ alſo to the Eaſt, and <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> to the Weſt: as for ☿, he is indifferent to the other ſix according to the conjunction of his rays with them. For if he applies himſelf to ♄, he produceth great winds, cloudy or rainy weather; if to ♃, warm gales with
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:116029:56"/>ſome rain; to ♂ or ☉ hot and corrupt winds; and with ☿ or <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> moiſt winds. If ☿ changes his latitude, it argues winds; if ſtationary or retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade, or going from one ſign and entring the other, betokeneth great winds: ♄ alſo doth alter the weather for many days together, in his remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving from any one ſign into another, eſpecially being retrograde, and having latitude towards the pole elevated, and the <hi>Apogaeon</hi> or <hi>Perigaeon</hi> of the Planets is to be conſidered.</p>
                  <p>There is never any great mutation of the <hi>Air</hi> without the ☌ or aſpect either of ♄, ♃ or ♂, by reaſon their motions are ſo ſlow; great ☌ of <hi>Planets</hi> that are of contrary naures, do cauſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary winds, much rain, hail or ſnow, according to the ſeaſon of the year; hail is multiplied by the ☌ of hot Planets in fiery <hi>Signs;</hi> the wandring <hi>Stars</hi> in their ſwift motions do beget drought, and likewiſe if they be direct and Oriental; but if ſlow, retrograde or occidental, they do produce rain, excepting ♂; and ſtationary they do gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally cauſe winds; and ☿ inſtability of the <hi>Air,</hi> and likewiſe many ☌ or Aſpects of the <hi>Planets</hi> concurring at one time, do pronounce great mutability of the weather, and do uſually very much diſtemper the Element; in this <hi>Cardanus</hi> is oppugnant to <hi>Leupold.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here we are arrived, having paſt many ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous Meanders, and obſcure Laborinths of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Hypotheſis, concerning the nature and effects of the fixed and wandring <hi>Stars,</hi> through which I cannot guide you in a direct line with a thread, but am forced to follow the obſervations of others, and the rules by them preſcribed, and delivered
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:116029:57"/>to Aſtronomers by ſucceſſion, from one enſuing Age unto another; yet with ſeveral opinions, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the diverſity of men, and the Countrys they lived in, as <hi>Aegypt, Italy, Germany,</hi> and the like: Theſe ſeveral temperatures of <hi>Climates,</hi> have cauſed errors in our later obſervations whereas their rules were true perhaps in thoſe Regions where they did inhabite. I have therefore delivered ſome things twice, to ſhew how ſeveral mens opinions do concur; others again I have given you almoſt oppugnant, yet may be in ſome things reconciled; which to do, I refer to your candid Judgement, to chooſe, correct, or reject, as you pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>I have ſhewn you rules and prognoſtications of the weather, both for days, years, and the ſeveral ſeaſons thereof, as by the fixed <hi>Stars</hi> and <hi>Planets,</hi> with the effects of their influences commixt, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to humane conjectures.) And now I will place before your eyes, predictions of the weather by mutual Aſpects of the <hi>Planets,</hi> only with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; which way is generally held and approved for to be the beſt and moſt aſſured tract to follow, as in things that depends upon ſo many and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain cauſes; yet it is convenient to ponder in your judgement the former rules preſcribed, and thoſe well weighed and conſidered, I will leave it to your application, and ſo proceed to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of <hi>Maginus,</hi> with ſome diligent collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of my own annexed thereunto.</p>
                  <p>But firſt there ought to be conſidered whether either <hi>Planet</hi> were retrograde at the time of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juction, or in any other Aſpect; of which theſe are the chiefeſt, and held of greateſt power in

                  <p n="20">20. The <hi>Sun</hi> riſing clear, and not fiery red, prenotes a fair day; but if pale and warm, it argues ſnow, hail or rain; if purple colour, wind and rain.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. If the <hi>Sun</hi> at his riſing appeareth hollow, it argues rain.</p>

                  <p n="29">29. Red clouds, or of purple colour, appearing in the North or in the Weſt, at the <hi>Sun</hi> riſing, denotes either wind or rain.</p>

                  <p n="38">38. If there be red clouds about the <hi>Sun</hi> at his riſing, which do become black or dark ſoon after he is up, it preſages rain.</p>

                  <p>THe natural cauſe of theſe (as I ſuppoſe) is this, the <hi>Air</hi> in the lower Region (being apt for either heat or cold) does alter according to the inclination of the weather, whether it be diſpoſed to heat, cold, rain, or wind; the <hi>Air</hi> thus altering, when it becomes wateriſh, makes the flaming fire

Whirlwinds do predict approaching ſtorms uſually of rain or hail; theſe you may foreſee by raiſing the duſt, or any ſuch light materials; and and oftentimes theſe whirlwinds are forerunners of great tempeſts; for it is a windy exhalation driven obliquely upon the horizontal plain, and forced down by the coldneſſe or moiſture of the preſent <hi>Air</hi> in the lower Region; this repercurſion of the <hi>Air</hi> cauſeth chimneys to ſmoak more then uſually they do at other times, preſaging rain or great winds.</p>

                  <p>SIgns both of the weather, and the ſeaſons I have hewn you, yet have omitted many, but ſuch as are beſt known to thoſe who are ſenſible of them; and of theſe there be ſome who ſuppreſt with the heavy burden of many years, are forced to ſtoop and ſtrike ſail to <hi>time,</hi> their bodies almoſt worn out with old decrepit age, ſcarcely tenent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the vital parts, which <hi>Nature</hi> can hardly inable for to keep poſſeſſion, being dayly in danger to be ejected by rigid Death, who admits no bail; ſuch as theſe are ſenſible of the <hi>Airs</hi> alteration; like an old ruined tenement, that lies open unto the aſſaults of every little ſtorm, and may unhappily know the weather and ſeaſons of the year.</p>
                  <p>Others there be in the glory and prime of their youth that do know all this, and more certainly then can the dictates of old age deliver it, having in every joynt a <hi>Calender</hi> that ſhews them the weather, with the Spring and Fall, as a <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randum</hi> of their fond and licentious youth, wherein they have incurred the diſpleaſure of juſt <hi>Heaven,</hi> and rewarded with the fruits of ſin: Yet in this I do not cenſure all, for ſome knows it through the crimes of others, and many by caſualties, fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of bones, bruiſes, old ſores, aches, cramps, gouts, corns of their feet, agues, and almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable diſeaſes and imperfections of <hi>Nature,</hi> incident to frail man, for excepting ſuch like acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:116029:81"/>or ſigns derived from experience, or ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon ſome reaſon to be held weather-wiſe, is an argument of folly.</p>
                  <p>The cauſe why Ideots can ſo well fore-know the weathers alteration, is partly they being defective in their underſtandings (as wanting the uſe of reaſon) <hi>Nature</hi> does the more aſſiſt them; or they being cold and phlegmatick (as appears by their ſlavering) they are the more ſenſible of the <hi>Airs</hi> change, as it is agreeable or oppugnant to the temperature and conſtitution of their bodies; whereas <hi>Man</hi> endowed with the uſe of reaſon and diſcourſe, contemplates of the cauſe and nature of things, which ſo implies the ſenſes, that the <hi>Air</hi> infuſed into the poars of ſuch bodies, cannot have any powerful operation; and beſides, their conſtitutions are compoſed with a better concord of the 4 <hi>Elements,</hi> ſo that the <hi>Airs</hi> alteration can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo ſoon and ſenſibly work thoſe effects in ſuch bodies, being perfectly in health, and reaſon of their counſel. For 'tis <hi>Natures</hi> care to provide beſt for thoſe things which are in moſt danger of ſhorteſt life, or can leaſt help or ſhift for themſelves; as to ſome ſhe gives ſtrength in arms, to others ſwiftneſſe of feet or wings, agility of body, and the like; ſome little creatures are made a prey by others, or their lives but ſhort; to theſe ſhe gives a fruitful offspring; as for example, what multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of little Birds, more then Eagles, or fowls of prey? Herrings in number exceeding Whales, with compariſon; behold alſo the providence of the immenſe <hi>Creator,</hi> that all theſe ſeveral kinds do ſubſiſt, and in ſuch Springs or Sommers whoſe temperatures of heat ſhall produce cold Winters;
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:116029:82"/>there <hi>Nature</hi> does commonly provide plenty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand, as Akorns, Hipps, Hawes, and divers other ſorts of Berries, for the ſubſiſtance of ſundry ſorts of little birds &amp; animals, that otherwiſe would have periſhed with cold, and for want of meat, which is armour of proof againſt the weather.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>Natures</hi> inſtinct from theſe, <hi>Man</hi> (as in a Calender) may read the weather, and the ſeaſons of the year, every body having ſmall poars, into which the <hi>Air</hi> does continually infuſe it ſelf; and as it is rarified or condenſed, it alters the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the body; but more or leſſe, according to the conſtitution, and as it is agreeable or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the natural temperature thereof; as for an inſtance, Bees and Emmots being of a fiery nature, (as appears by their choler and induſtry) the <hi>Air</hi> infuſed into their little members, towards rain (being moiſt, and oppoſite to their natures) ſtupifies their ſenſes, and makes them heavy, and not apt to labour or go abroad.</p>
                  <p>This is the cauſe that Bees keep in their hives, or will not go far from thence, when the <hi>Air</hi> grows moiſt; and the weather inclining to rain; from hence is the motive that the laborious Emmots deſire reſt, and withdraw themſelves into the caverns of the earth, carrying their eggs with them, as by a natural inſtinct, whereby to preſerve their progeny; for by the fervour of the <hi>Sun,</hi> they muſt be diſcloſed, and by a ſtorm of rain they would be chill and periſh; the reaſon is generally the ſame in other ſenſitive creatures, whoſe corps are ſenſible of the <hi>Airs</hi> change, that alters them according to the natural temperature and diſpoſition of their bodies, ſome creatures
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:116029:82"/>requiring heat, others moiſture; what pleaſes one, diſtaſts ſome other, and ſo of all living things. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamanders</hi> love <hi>Fire; Birds Air; Fiſhes Water;</hi> and <hi>Beaſts Earth:</hi> So theſe <hi>Elements</hi> (as they are mixt) and predominating, do offend or pleaſe the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural diſpoſition of the creature.

                  <p>This being provided, take the circumference of the globe at <hi>A,</hi> (with ¼ part more or 4 diameters if you can) and place it on the ſhank with a ſtring equidiſtant from the head, as at the ceſtern, there make two marks, and divide that ſpace into

                  <p>Obſerve at what figure the water ſtands (let it at the firſt be too high,) then raiſe up gently the long glaſſe, ſo that the water may fall down into the ceſtern, and try it for two or three days; and when it is at a place that fits the temperature of the <hi>Air,</hi> and Seaſon of the year, <hi>viz.</hi> 1, 2, or 3. if it be in the heat of Sommer; but at 13, 14, or 15. in the cold of Winter: if a little froſt (ſuch as we have in <hi>September</hi>) place it at 9, or 10: but if very temperate weather, as between hot and cold, the water muſt ſtand at 8 a <hi>medium;</hi> having tri'd and fitted it well according to the temperature of the outward <hi>Air,</hi> (for it muſt be kept from fire and accidental heat) cloſe it or lute it up at the neck of the ceſtern, leaving onely ſome cane for a vent (as you ſee at <hi>C:</hi>) whereby the <hi>Air</hi> may paſſe in or out of the ceſtern accordingly as the water doth riſe or fall; for the long glaſſe muſt always ſtand in the water, and almoſt touch the bottome of the receiver or lower veſſel, as at <hi>B;</hi> if the <hi>Air</hi> gets into the long glaſſe anywhere, (after it is placed according to the weather) the work is fruſtrated.</p>

                  <p>This is the ſole cauſe, that glaſſes break in fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty weather, being cloſe ſtopp'd, and not full of liquor; for the <hi>Air</hi> contracting, and having no pores or paſſage, for a ſupply of more, the veſſel of neceſſity muſt crack: and by rarifaction the ſame may be effected, as common experience proves in glaſſe <hi>Alembicks,</hi> or other cloſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave veſſels, which are burſt by reſtraint of the rarified incloſed Air; and if theſe bodies could extend themſelves like bladders, the included air
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:116029:87"/>might be dilated unto an irruption at laſt, with a noyſe like <hi>Meteors</hi> ſwell'd to Tympanies in the wombs of pregnant clouds; from rarifaction of Air proceeds this experiment; Take a globe, or round glaſſe luted up cloſe, and having rarified the confined air by natural or artificial heat, you may throw the glaſſe againſt a ſtone, 'twill bound and not break by any violence that exceeds not the extenſion of the dilated impriſon'd air: And here in theſe ſmall things I have briefly prov'd how active this <hi>Element</hi> is in avoiding either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs or defect, ſuperfluity or a <hi>vacuum,</hi> and in an inſtant contracts or rarifies as <hi>Nature</hi> ſees apteſt or moſt facile to be effected, and thus avoids va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity in all bodies; for if any place be empty, 'twill be found in ſome extravagant defendants, or in orbicular heads, enemies to order, emblemes of a <hi>Chaos, Natures</hi> abortives or falſe conceptions; but leſt this diſcourſe ſhould be ſo much dilated for to make ſome break into choller, I will return to the Weather glaſs (my former ſubject) not ſo fragile as they.</p>
                  <p>The falling of this incloſed Water is according to the natural property and courſe of all ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous bodies, inclining towards the center and ſeat of gravity, if not hindred by ſome greater force, or natural affection to attract them; ſo this tends downwards accordingly as the incloſed Air can dilate it ſelf; for the <hi>Element</hi> rarifying (as againſt rain or hot weather) that contained above the water in the glaſs, muſt imitate it, in the ſame proportion; which appears by this; for to be ⅕ or ⅙ part more in the extreme heat of Sommer then in the greateſt cold of Winter; but not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood

                  <p>The temper of your body you may try, by laying your hand upon the head of the glaſs; for the hotter you are, the more the water will fall; and take your hand off, the water will preſently riſe, recovering its former place or temper; and for a demonſtration let this ſuffice.</p>
                  <p>I have preſented to your view as in a glaſs both natural and artificial preſages of the weather: for all knowledge (meerly humane) is but as a ſhadow of <hi>Science,</hi> or a ſuperficial learning, reflecting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mans imagination, as objects repreſented on a mirrour, and not ſubſtantially comprehending, the leaſt thing created: ſo expect not from me (the meaneſt of men) infallible predictions, but conjectures, and moſt of thoſe collected from the obſervations of others, bound up in this little Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, and order'd in the beſt form I could deviſe: &amp; as for better reaſons in theſe natural cauſes and effects of <hi>Metcors,</hi> I will refer them unto your <hi>calm</hi> and <hi>ſerene cenſure,</hi> for to paraphraſe upon, and explain the obſcure and hidden myſteries of

                  <hi>Rothmannus</hi> conceives that Comets are really enflamed Meteors, and that they are moved by <hi>Angels,</hi> as for a terrour unto mortals; but as for this ſuppoſition: <hi>God</hi> does commonly uſe, and employ natural means, unto natural cauſes; but

                  <p>BEfore the Nativity of our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Saviour</hi> 766, in the Raign of <hi>Rivallus</hi> (a Britiſh King) for three days ſpace it rained bloud, out of which corruption, there enſued multitudes of venemous Flies, which killed many men, and bred a morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, with deſolation almoſt unto the whole I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland; This is collected from the Britiſh anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</p>
                  <p>A little before the death of <hi>Nero</hi> the Tyrant and Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> it rained bloud with many other prodigies, as you may read in <hi>Livy.</hi>

                  <p>In the year ſince the Sacred <hi>Virgin</hi> was a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 1534, about the Feaſt celebrated for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> it rained bloud in <hi>Germany;</hi> which falling upon Mens garments, did deſcribe the form of red Croſſes, to put us in mind (peradventure) of His cruel Paſſion, a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for the whole World. In the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries (neer about this time) the skins of men and women were ſigned in this manner, in a ſhower of bloud.</p>
                  <p>In the year of our <hi>Redeemer</hi> 1571, at a place called <hi>Emden</hi> in <hi>Friſia,</hi> there fell in the night time a great ſhower of bloud, which diſcoloured the earth, and all it fell upon, for the ſpace of 5 or 6 miles in compaſſe; and in ſuch plenty, that divers cups were fill'd the next day with it; about theſe times, began cruel and bloudy wars by the Sacramentarians. In the year 1601 the like of theſe prodigies began and continued the ſpace of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:116029:98"/>3 years, and then was ſeconded with a woeful plague.</p>

Others ſay this Plague took its ſad Exordium from fire that fell from Heaven: the moſt authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick <hi>Chronologers</hi> record it thus; <hi>Lamech,</hi> a City of <hi>Arabia,</hi> now known by the name of <hi>Mecha,</hi> the <hi>Metropolitan</hi> of the <hi>Antichriſtian Mahumetans</hi> ſuperſtition; in this City it rained Bloud and Snakes the ſpace of three days and nights toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the Serpents ſoon after periſhed in ſuch multitudes, that the ſtench of their corrupted bodies contaminated the Air in all the adjacent
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:116029:105"/>Regions; this ſtupendious ſtorm raz'd <hi>Mahumets</hi> Temple to the ground, and ſever'd into many pieces the Sepulchre of that infernal Impoſtor: The next year the Earth denyed her accuſtomed fruits, introducing a Famine more mortiferous then the former; theſe direful calamities not moving man to repentance, (O incredulous and obdurate hearts!) but contemning thoſe dreadful judgements, were pleaſed with their enemies fall, until they fell themſelves; Piety expulſed, fled into exile, while envy and confuſion in Arms, put the world in an uproar, the ſword licenſed in the hands of <hi>Furies,</hi> making a rude decimation of thoſe who had eſpaced both Plague and Famine.</p>
                  <p>Theſe three laſt deplorable afflictions, were the moſt univerſal and deſtructive that the world ever felt, or the Inhabitants groaned under ſince the general Deluge, when in 40. days all living ſouls were deſtroyed from off the face of the Earth, but what the Ark was fraighted withal, whereby to replant the world again; and thoſe for many months were wafted over the angry waves, that lav'd the Earth polluted with enormous crimes, and tranſgreſſions of unbelieving licentious men, only under the Law of Nature, to which brute Beaſts ſubject themſelves. This Ark repreſented the figure of Baptiſm, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.20, 21. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over St. <hi>Hierome</hi> calls it a Type of the Catholike Church; the raging ſtorms and tumultuous billows (in oppoſition to one another) reſemble <hi>Herefies</hi> and <hi>Perſecutions;</hi> the Ark out-lived the fury of the Deluge, and ſo ſhall the other to the worlds conſummation; all periſhed that were
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:116029:105"/>not in the firſt, ſo I need ſay no more of the laſt.</p>
                  <p>Hiſtoriographers conjecture that more Men, Women, and Children periſhed in one of theſe Epidemical diſeaſes, then in the univerſal Flood; the World being conceived more populous then in the days of <hi>Noah,</hi> and the continuance much longer; many will not believe theſe (being but humane traditions) and 'tis not ſtrange, ſince they want faith in divine Records; whereof ſome object that if the Deluge were 15. cubits above the higheſt Hills, the ſuperficies of the Waters (on which the Ark floated) was ſwell'd up to the middle Region of the Air, in which no living creature can ſubſiſt; beſides, they make queries from whence ſhould theſe magazins of Waters be extracted? the Fountains of the Earth they conceive not ſufficient; the Clouds are but thin dilated vapours; the Waters mentioned above the Firmament could not deſcend ſo low in 100. years, without a miracle.</p>
                  <p>To their objections, I might anſwer, 'twas the providence of God which preſerved them, to whom nothing is impoſſible, being ſole Creator and Moderator of the Univerſe; but ſince an Omnipotent and divine power condeſcended to make Mans preſervation by a humane means, humane reaſons may be expected, for which I refer the over curious unto the learned <hi>Expoſitors</hi> of <hi>Geneſis;</hi> yet not to leave them in a Sea at laſt, ſomething I will ſay, not poſitively affirmed, but conjecturally intimated only.</p>
                  <p>As for their Suppoſitions, the whole Element of Air is held naturally hot and moiſt, and the middle Region cold but by accident, which
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:116029:106"/>frigid and reſtringent cauſe being chang'd, the quality muſt ceaſe, and ſo the Air (in general) might convert to vapours innumerable; and the waters in the Earth (peradventure) were dilated, and ſo made more fluxible, whoſe Fountains were opened for 40. continued days, the Catar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racts deſcending from their overburthned clouds; which time (to humane apprehenſion) might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the inundation to ſubmerge the terreſtrial Globe 15. Cubits above the higheſt hills, whereof 'tis probable the <hi>Armenian</hi> mountains were moſt exalted above the Earths center; and as the clouds were exonerated by the waters that fell, 'tis like this inferiour Air did aſcend, and aſſume the middle Regions Sphere, and ſo made apt for all living creatures to breath in.</p>
                  <p>The Deluge ebbing, Mount <hi>Ararat</hi> appear'd, on whoſe firm foundation the Ark reſted; the Waters by an orderly ſummons retreated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome to repleniſh the Earths entrails and exhauſted veins; others confin'd to channels of ſpacious Rivers, ample Lakes, and Oceans almoſt unter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated; a great part (by the influence of Stars) might be ſublim'd, and reconverted to vapours, thence rarifying to Air, aſcend their proper Orbs again, the groſſer parts ſink to their ſeats of gravity, and ſo will I, this being above my Sphere; yet pleaſed in recollecting my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation paſt, the hope of one in future, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports my mind beyond a Deluge, the landing Eternity.</p>
